# Arduino_Turet_Tank
Here i upload my progress and code about my turret tank

My goal is to create a nerf tank with a motorised nerf blaster which can be controlled with a phone and a website

the tank should have replaceble tank heads one for nerf bullets and other for ball bullets (or i can just make thenm into one )
